Brian2GeNN specific preferences
===============================

Connectivity
------------
The preference ``prefs.devices.genn.connectivity`` determines what
connectivity scheme is used within GeNN to represent the connections
between neurons. GeNN supports the use of full connectivity matrices
('DENSE') or a representation where connections are represented with
sparse matrix methods ('SPARSE').
